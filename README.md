## 🚀 What I'm Working On

### 📝 Full-Stack Multi-User Note-Taking App  
A secure, multi-user application built with **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **EJS**, enabling multiple users to register, log in, and independently create, edit, and manage their personal notes with full **CRUD functionality**.

- 🔐 Integrated secure **authentication** using **Passport.js**, with session handling and route protection ensuring users only access their own notes  
- 🗂️ Structured the backend using **MVC architecture**, with dedicated routes, controllers, and models  
- 💬 Implemented both **flash messages** and **inline Express validations** to deliver clear, context-aware error feedback and improve form UX  
- 🎨 Built a clean and responsive front end using **EJS templates**, layout inheritance, and modular partials
